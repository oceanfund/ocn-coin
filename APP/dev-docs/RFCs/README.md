# RFC Directory (deck.gl)

Implementation of non-trivial new deck.gl features should typically be started off with the creation of an RFC (Request for Comments) to make sure we have a complete story. It also allow the bigger team (as well as the community) to comment and contribute insights.

| RFC Status       | Description |
| ---              | --- |
| **Proposed**     | Call for an RFC to be written |
| **Draft**        | Work-in-progress, not ready for formal review |
| **Pre-Approved** | No major initial objections, draft pre-approved for prototyping |
| **Review**       | Ready for formal review |
| **Approved**     | Approved, ready for implementation |
| **Implemented**  | Approved and implemented |
| **Deferred**     | Review uncovered reasons not to proceed at this time |
| **Rejected**     | Review uncovered reasons not to proceed |

## Reviews

The core developers will review RFCs (and of course, comments from the community are always welcome). Recommended review criteria are being documented in [RFC Review Guidelines](../common/RFC-REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md).

## Longer-Terms RFCs

These are early ideas not yet associated with any release

| RFC | Author | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Reviewed/Deferred** | | | |
| [**Partial Updates**](v6.0/partial-updates-rfc.md) | @ibgreen | **Deferred** | Allow partial updates of vertex attributes to support high-performance editing. Deferred due to performance of complete updates being so good this was not needed. |
| [**Off-thread attribute generation**](v6.0/off-thread-attribute-generation.md) | @pessimistress | **Deferred** | Generate attributes off-thread (to avoid locking the main thread). Deferred due to issues with supporting the more general use cases. **dataUrl RFC** has been broken out. |
| | | | |
| **WIP/Draft** | | | |
| [**Projection Mode Improvements**](vNext/projection-mode-improvements-rfc.md) | @ibgreen @pessimistress | **Draft** | Improvements to projection system |
| [**Composite Layer Customization**](vNext/composite-layer-customization-rfc.md) | @ibgreen | **Draft** | Improvements to customizing composite layers |
| [**Shader Module Injection**](vNext/shader-module-injection-rfc.md) | @ibgreen | **Draft** | |


## v6.0 RFCs

Current direction for [deck.gl v6.0](https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/projects/3) is to focus on **animation** and **visual effects**, so we want to prioritize related RFCs. In particular, the topic of animation is big, and it has been broken down into a number of separete RFCs that should all move us in the right direction.

| RFC | Author | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Animation** | | | |
| [**Property Animation**](v6.0/property-animation-rfc.md) | @ibgreen | Draft | Allow Layer props and GL parameters to accept functions in addition to values and call these on every render to update values |
| [**Attribute Animation**](v6.0/attribute-animation-rfc.md) | @pessimistress | Proposed | Automatically interpolate between two copies of a vertex attributes |
| [**PropTypes**](v6.0/prop-types-rfc.md) | ? | Draft | Validate e.g ranges for numeric attributes, support animation/auto-interpolation. |
| [**Expose Layer AttributeManager**](v6.0/expose-attribute-manager.md) | @ibgreen | **Review** | simplifies pregenerating attributes in apps for fast animation. |
| | | | |
| **Effects** | | | |
| **[Effects Manager](v6.0/effects-manager-rfc.md)** | @1chandu @ibgreen | Draft | Official support for effects (shadows, reflections, better lighting, postprocessing, framebuffer composition etc).  |
| **[Render Layer to Texture](v6.0/render-layer-to-texture-rfc.md)** | TBD | Proposed | Allow layers to render to texture and then use texture in subsequent layers.  |
| | | | |
| **Ease-of-Use** | | | |
| [**dataUrl**](v6.0/data-url-rfc.md) | @pessimistress & @ibgreen | Draft | **Ease-of-Use** Allow deck.gl layers to specify a URL and asynchronously download the resulting data |
| | | | |
| **Internals** | | | |
| [**Reduce Distribution Size**](v6.0/reduce-distribution-size-rfc.md) | @ibgreen | **Review** | **Hygiene** Reduce size of distribution and the bundle size of apps consuming deck.gl |
| [**Reduce Repository Size**](v6.0/reduce-repo-size-rfc.md) | @ibgreen | **Draft** | **Hygiene** Reduce size of deck.gl github repository |

Possible other animation related RFCs:
- integration with event handling (enter leave triggers for animations)
